Our solution aims to help individuals identify and understand their 
underlying emotions, which can be a crucial step in managing mental health conditions. 

With this, we are currently developing a diary mobile application where people
may share their thoughts or their feelings for the day. Moreover, the application
has a state-of-the-art AI that can classify the text entered by the user.

Currently, since the mobile application is still on the works, we provide you
a demo for the Muni App. Unfortunately, a demo version of Muni has limited features
available

To access the demo, you can proceed to this link: muni.app/demo


The app features a language transformer from HuggingFace. It is can classify 
7 emotions based from text input (anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, and surprise).
